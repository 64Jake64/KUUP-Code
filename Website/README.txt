Hey!
these are the website files for KUUP!
honestly it doesn't matter...
cause these aren't the ACTUAL website files...
or well they are but editing them won't do anything...
UNLESS you're on the GitHub repo and a developer/contributer... then it actually does something...
UNLESS (again) you are editing these ONLY on your local machine...
