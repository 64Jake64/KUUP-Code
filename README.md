# KUUP-Code
A programming language meant to be easy but powerful (enough)


KUUP is meant to be a programming language for beginners that *doesn't* limit them (or at least not much)

KUUP is currently under development but *soon* should probably have a demo... no release date for anything KUUP is known right now...
